# About Playlite

**Playlite** is a desktop game library manager focused on local-first use, privacy, and smart recommendations.

It was created to help players with large libraries decide **what to play next**, offering a simple, fast experience
focused on offline use, without requiring external services after installation, library import, and game data download.

The project also serves as a study of modern desktop technologies, but always with the end-user experience as the main
focus.

## User Privacy and Data

Privacy is a core principle in Playlite.

- All data is stored **locally** on the user's computer
- No personal information is collected, sent, or shared
- The app works **offline**
- There is no tracking, telemetry, or analytics

Playlite does not require a login or account to work.

## External APIs and Services

Playlite uses external APIs **only during the initial import** of the game library and metadata download, such as
covers, descriptions, and ratings. After that step, the app operates entirely locally.

Some optional features depend on internet access, such as:

- Searching for trending and upcoming games via the RAWG API
- Price and deal search via the IsThereAnyDeal API
- Searching for free games via the GamerPower API

These services are accessed securely, without sending personal data, and only when the user chooses to use them.

## AI as an Optional Feature

Playlite offers an optional automatic translation feature for game descriptions using artificial intelligence services
through the Gemini API.

## Use of AI in Development

Playlite was developed with the support of artificial intelligence tools as part of the software development process.

This use of AI happened **only during project creation**, as a support tool for writing code, documentation, and
exploring ideas. No AI runs inside the app.

- Playlite runs locally and offline
- There is no collection or sending of personal information

The goal of using AI during development was to speed up project creation, make it easier to learn new technologies, and
improve the overall quality of the software, always with human validation of the final decisions.

## Transparency

Playlite takes a transparent approach to how it was developed and how it works.

Additional technical details, architecture, and implementation decisions are available in the developer-focused
documentation and in the project's official repository.
